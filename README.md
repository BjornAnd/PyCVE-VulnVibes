# PyCVE-VulnVibes

**PyCVE-VulnVibes** is a Python-based GUI tool designed to fetch and visualize EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) scores for a given CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier using the [FIRST.org API](https://www.first.org/epss/model). The tool allows users to input a CVE identifier and view a time-series plot of EPSS scores, helping security professionals understand the exploitability trends of a specific vulnerability.

## Features

- Simple GUI interface using `Tkinter`.
- Fetches EPSS scores for a given CVE from the FIRST API.
- Displays a time-series graph of EPSS scores, providing a visual representation of the exploitability trends.
- Error handling for invalid CVE identifiers or network/API issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `matplotlib` library

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install requests matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Command Line

You can run the application directly from the command line by passing a CVE identifier as an argument:

```bash
python VulnVibes.py CVE-YYYY-####
```

If no CVE identifier is provided, the input field in the GUI will remain empty by default.

### GUI Interface

1. Launch the program by running:

   ```bash
   python VulnVibes.py
   ```

2. Enter a valid CVE identifier (format: `CVE-YYYY-####`) in the input field.
3. Click the button labeled **Enter CVE** to fetch and display the EPSS scores.

If no CVE is entered, the program will default to a pre-defined identifier for testing purposes (`CVE-2024-6670`).

## Example

When a CVE identifier is provided, the tool fetches the associated EPSS scores and displays them in a time-series plot. Below is an example of what you might see after querying a CVE:

## Error Handling

- If the API request fails (e.g., due to a network issue or invalid CVE), an error message will be displayed.
- If no CVE identifier is entered, a warning will prompt the user to provide input.
